While socio-enactive systems are promising for learning purposes, different aspects of the environment can impact the development of these systems in an educational context. This paper presents a framework to develop such systems, named Socio-Enactive Educational System Framework (SEES Framework). The framework is based on Human-Computer Interaction and learning theories and is illustrated with a case study conducted with people of different ages.

The active interaction in the reading of these texts brings cognitive advantages, since it changes interpretation of its contents.

Thus, this work proposes a framework for the construction of systems with the concept of Collaborative Reading in the Physico-Virtual environment (CRPV). This framework is based on Organizational Semiotics artifacts, the structure of hypertexts and the concept of enaction. In this work, text structures of this model and corresponding multimodal interfaces were created. The CRPV scenarios implement the interactions with contemporary technologies, including augmented reality, seeking to achieve the concept of an enactive and socio-enactive system. One of these scenarios has already been tested and the initial experiment showed engagement and high motivation of participants in the activity. This research has the potential to contribute to the creation of new spaces and reading processes through multimodal interfaces studies, offering highly dynamic interactions in environments that can be built at low cost."},"3":{"title":"Sistemas socioenativos para leitura colaborativa: constru\xe7\xe3o t\xe9cnica, pedag\xf3gica e de design","conference":"WTD IC Unicamp","time":"Nov 2018","description":"Este artigo aborda a cria\xe7\xe3o de um framework te\xf3rico e t\xe9cnico para desenvolver sistemas socioenativos para educa\xe7\xe3o, com a concep\xe7\xe3o de um sistema que implementa o conceito de leitura colaborativa com uso de tecnologias contempor\xe2neas em um ambiente F\xedsico-Virtual.
